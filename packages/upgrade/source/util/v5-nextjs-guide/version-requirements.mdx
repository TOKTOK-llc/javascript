## Minimum version requirements

We have updated some of our minumum version requirements for Node.js, React, and Next.js such that versions that are no longer supported or are at end-of-life are no longer guaranteed to work correctly with Clerk. Please take a moment to check your dependencies and ensure you are up to date!

#### Updating Node.js

You need to have Node.js `18.17.0` or later installed. Last year, Node.js 16 entered EOL (End of life) status so it's time to bump the required version for `@clerk/nextjs`, too. You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v` in your terminal. Learn more about how to [update and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).

#### Updating React

`@clerk/nextjs` now requires you to use React 18 or higher. You can update your project by installing the latest version of `react` and `react-dom`.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm add react@latest react-dom@latest
    ```

</CodeBlockTabs>

If you are upgrading from React 17 or lower, make sure to [learn about how to upgrade your React version to 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide) as well.

#### Updating Next.js

`@clerk/nextjs` now requires you to use Next.js version `13.0.4` or later. Check out Next's upgrade guides for more guidance if you have not yet upgraded to Next.js 13:
