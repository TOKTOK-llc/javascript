# Upgrading Next.js from v4 to v5

By the end of this guide, you’ll have successfully upgraded your Next.js project to use `@clerk/nextjs` v5. You’ll learn how to update your dependencies, resolve breaking changes, and find deprecations.

Step-by-step instructions will lead you through the process. If you’re looking for a reference list of changes, check out the general [upgrading from v4 to v5 guide](/docs/upgrade-guides/upgrading-from-v4-to-v5).

To aid you in this upgrade, Clerk built a CLI called [`@clerk/upgrade`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/upgrade). Throughout this guide you'll see prompts to use the CLI which you can invoke directly in your terminal.
