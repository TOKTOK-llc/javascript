## Deprecation removals & housekeeping

As part of this major version, we have removed a large number of previously deprecated props, arugments, methods, etc, and made changes to things that are only realistically used internally, or only used very rarely. It's highly unlikely that any given app will encounter any of these items, but they are all breaking changes, so they have all been documented below.

<Callout type='info'>
  For this section more than any other one, we recommend using the CLI upgrade tool (`npx @clerk/upgrade`), since there
  are a lot of changes, each of which are very unlikely to appear in your codebase, that would take a very long time to
  look for manually.
