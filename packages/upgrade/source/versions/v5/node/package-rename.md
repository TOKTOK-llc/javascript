title: '`@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` renamed to `@clerk/express`'
matcher: "@clerk\\/clerk-sdk-node"
---

This package has been renamed to `@clerk/express` and the `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` package is now deprecated. Note that any other changes listed under the node sdk describe steps needed to migrate to `@clerk/express`, rather than changes needed for `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`, which will not change aside from security updates from here forward.
