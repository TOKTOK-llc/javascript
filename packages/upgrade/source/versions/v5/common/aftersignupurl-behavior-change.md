The default value of `afterSignUpUrl` has been changed to `/`. The URLs defined in your `Dashboard > Account Portal > Redirects` section will no longer affect these values. Read the [Customizing your Account Portal redirects](https://clerk.com/docs/account-portal/custom-redirects) guide to learn how to override these defaults.
