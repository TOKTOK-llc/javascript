## Updating to v5

Whenever you feel ready, go ahead and install the latest beta version of any Clerk SDKs you are using. Make sure that you are prepared to patch some breaking changes before your app will work properly, however. Some examples for how to unstall commonly used SDKs are below:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm install <%= packageName %>@beta
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn add <%= packageName %>@beta
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm add <%= packageName %>@beta
    ```

</CodeBlockTabs>
